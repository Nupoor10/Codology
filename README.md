## Project Overview
Codology is a platform that aims to facilitate the learning process for students interested in programming. It provides a unique interactive experience through the use of chatbots and educational modules. 

## Chatbots
We've incorporated four dedicated chatbots, each tailored to a specific programming language:

- **JavaBot:** Get assistance with Java programming, ask questions, and receive guidance.
- **PythonBot:** Explore the world of Python, seek help, and learn the fundamentals.
- **C++Bot:** Dive into C++ programming, find answers to your queries, and grasp the language.
- **JavaScriptBot:** Learn JavaScript, seek explanations, and improve your skills.

Our chatbots are here to assist you and enhance your understanding of these programming languages.

## Educational Modules
For each of the four programming languages, we've designed a set of educational modules to help beginners get started:

- **Introduction:** An overview of the language, its history, and its significance.
- **Basics:** Covers the fundamental concepts, syntax, and structure of the language.
- **Intermediate:** Delves deeper into advanced topics and practices.
- **Projects:** Offers hands-on projects and exercises to reinforce your learning.

Explore these modules to gain a comprehensive understanding of the programming language of your choice.
